# 🤖 Smart Review Analysis Results

## 📊 Executive Summary

🟡 **Code Quality Score:** 8.2/10
📝 **Total Issues Found:** 4
🚨 **Critical Issues:** 1
📁 **Files Analyzed:** 3

### 🎯 Priority Actions
1. Address 1 security issue(s) immediately
2. Consider performance optimization for database queries

---

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

#### 🔒 **src/auth.py:42** - 🔴 Significant Effort Security
**Confidence:** 95% | **Tags:** `security`, `sql`, `injection`

SQL injection vulnerability detected. User input is directly interpolated into query string without proper sanitization.

**💡 Recommended Fix:**
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

**🔧 Code Example:**
```diff
- query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}'"
+ query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=%s"
+ cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```

### 🟡 High Priority Issues

#### ⚡ **src/models.py:28** - 🟡 Moderate Effort Performance
**Confidence:** 87% | **Tags:** `performance`, `n+1-query`

N+1 query problem detected in user retrieval loop.

**💡 Recommended Fix:**
Use eager loading or bulk queries to reduce database calls.

## Advanced CI/CD Integration

### Enterprise GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's an example of how large organizations use diffscope in production CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
name: AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ai-code-review:
    name: AI Code Review with DiffScope
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout PR
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

      - name: Install DiffScope with Cache
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cargo/bin
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-diffscope-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
      
      - run: |
          if ! command -v diffscope &> /dev/null; then
            cargo install diffscope
          fi

      - name: Generate PR Diff
        run: |
          git diff origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}...HEAD > pr.diff

      - name: Run AI Review
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          diffscope review --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 \
            --diff pr.diff --output-format json > review.json

      - name: Post Review Comments
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const review = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('review.json', 'utf8'));
            
            let body = '## 🤖 AI Code Review\n\n';
            if (review.length === 0) {
              body += '✅ **No issues found!** Code looks good!';
            } else {
              body += review.map((item, i) => 
                `**${i+1}.** \`${item.file_path}:${item.line_number}\`\n` +
                `${item.content}\n` +
                (item.suggestion ? `\n💡 **Suggestion:** ${item.suggestion}\n` : '')
              ).join('\n---\n');
            }
            
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: body
            });
```

### Enterprise Configuration Example

For a large Python/FastAPI application at a company like Acme Inc:

**.diffscope.yml**
```yaml
# Acme Inc DiffScope Configuration
model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
temperature: 0.1  # Low for consistent reviews
max_tokens: 4000

system_prompt: |
  You are reviewing Python code for a production FastAPI application.
  
  Critical focus areas:
  - SQL injection and security vulnerabilities
  - Async/await correctness
  - Resource leaks and memory issues
  - API contract consistency
  - Production deployment concerns
  
  Prioritize by severity: Security > Performance > Maintainability

# File filters for monorepo
include_patterns:
  - "src/**/*.py"
  - "tests/**/*.py"
  - "alembic/versions/*.py"
  - "*.yml"
  - "Dockerfile*"

exclude_patterns:
  - "**/__pycache__/**"
  - "**/venv/**"
  - "**/.pytest_cache/**"
  - "**/node_modules/**"

# Review configuration
max_diff_size: 10000
context_lines: 3
```

### Integration with Other CI Tools

**GitLab CI Example:**
```yaml
code-review:
  stage: review
  image: rust:alpine
  only:
    - merge_requests
  script:
    - apk add --no-cache git
    - cargo install diffscope
    - git diff origin/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME...HEAD > mr.diff
    - diffscope smart-review --diff mr.diff --output review.md
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: review.md
```

**Jenkins Pipeline:**
```groovy
stage('AI Code Review') {
  steps {
    sh '''
      curl -sSL https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
      source $HOME/.cargo/env
      cargo install diffscope
      
      git diff origin/${env.CHANGE_TARGET}...HEAD > pr.diff
      diffscope review --diff pr.diff --output-format json > review.json
    '''
    
    publishHTML([
      allowMissing: false,
      alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
      keepAll: true,
      reportDir: '.',
      reportFiles: 'review.json',
      reportName: 'AI Code Review'
    ])
  }
}
```

### Best Practices for CI/CD Integration

1. **Cache Installation**: Cache cargo/diffscope binaries to speed up CI runs
2. **API Key Management**: Use secure secret storage for API keys
3. **Diff Size Limits**: Set max diff size to avoid timeouts on large PRs
4. **Custom Prompts**: Tailor system prompts to your tech stack and standards
5. **Output Parsing**: Handle both empty reviews and JSON parsing errors gracefully
6. **Conditional Runs**: Skip reviews on draft PRs or specific file types

## New Features in v0.5.0

### 🔄 Changelog Generation

Generate professional changelogs and release notes from your git history:

```bash
# Generate changelog from a specific tag to HEAD
diffscope changelog --from v0.4.0 --to HEAD

# Generate release notes for a new version
diffscope changelog --release v0.5.0 --from v0.4.0

# Output to file
diffscope changelog --from v0.4.0 --output CHANGELOG.md
```

The changelog generator:
- Parses conventional commits automatically
- Groups changes by type (features, fixes, etc.)
- Highlights breaking changes
- Shows contributor statistics
- Generates both changelogs and release notes formats

### 🎯 Path-Based Configuration

Customize review behavior for different parts of your codebase:

**.diffscope.yml**
```yaml
# Global configuration
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.2
max_tokens: 4000

# Exclude patterns
exclude_patterns:
  - "**/*.generated.*"
  - "**/node_modules/**"

# Path-specific rules
paths:
  # API endpoints need security focus
  "src/api/**":
    focus:
      - security
      - validation
      - authentication
    severity_overrides:
      security: error  # All security issues become errors
    system_prompt: |
      Focus on SQL injection, auth bypass, and input validation

  # Test files have different standards
  "tests/**":
    focus:
      - coverage
      - assertions
    severity_overrides:
      style: suggestion  # Style issues are just suggestions

  # Database migrations are critical
  "migrations/**":
    severity_overrides:
      bug: error  # Any bug in migrations is critical
```

### 💬 Interactive PR Commands

Respond to pull request comments with interactive commands:

```
@diffscope review                 # Re-review the changes
@diffscope review security        # Focus review on security
@diffscope ignore src/generated/  # Ignore specific paths
@diffscope explain line 42        # Explain specific code
@diffscope generate tests         # Generate unit tests
@diffscope help                   # Show all commands
```

### 📊 PR Summary Generation

Generate executive summaries for pull requests:

```bash
# Generate PR summary with statistics
diffscope pr --summary

# Generate and post to GitHub
diffscope pr --number 123 --summary --post-comments
```

The summary includes:
- Change statistics and impact analysis
- Key modifications by category
- Risk assessment
- Review recommendations
